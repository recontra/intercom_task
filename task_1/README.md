Pretty simple question, but answer is really hard. I think we should solve our every task in way that we can be proud of it. Of course, not every code, project or task is worthy of "Hall of fame".

One of my first biggest achievements that I’m really proud of is “Annual financial report module for custom ERP system”.  This was project in one of my first companies. Windows forms application built in .NET, accountant software for reporting. All things that are not in my focus anymore.

But why am I still proud of it?

Well, task was assign to me as some kind of pilot project with new technology and with pretty loose idea of final result. Next 4 mounts were spent in communicating with project manager/accountant and developing this idea. She wanted to solve nightmare for accountants, but she didn’t believe that we can do it from technical side. In the end, we really did it. In 4 mounts, I build application that was using data from our big ERP and, with a lot of settings and user defined formulas, producing reports that are required from government. Of course, all with proper installer and update strategy which is in world of desktop apps real challenge. Well, at least it was 5 years ago.

Most important thing I learned with it was not really tech related. I build many “better” things after it. But this was my first project built from scratch. I learned to tackle the problem, I learned how to ask right questions and how to communicate with end user and project manager. And in the end, providing that application to dozens of clients and getting great response was really worth it.
